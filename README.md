# sysy-compiler

This is the solution to sysy compiler lab of Peking University Compiler Principle class. These codes are certainly not the best and leave a lot of space for optimization. 
The code organization is somewhat disasterous. If you have any problems, probably you are right. 

## Code organization:

The four files are corresponding to the frame given by https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/, and the whole environment are discussed in this reference. Specifically, docker.txt gives some handy instructions to set up the environment quickly, which can be used as a tip.

## Warning:

Copying is strongly forbiddened. The codes in this repo should not be directly copied to finish the lab. If you have any difficulties in this lab, please refer to the guide book or my blog https://www.cnblogs.com/zhangleo/p/15963442.html which gives a detailed description of each part in the lab. Have fun :)
