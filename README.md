# sysy-compiler

This is the solution to sysy compiler lab of Peking University Compiler Principle class. These codes are certainly not the best and leave a lot of space for optimization. 

## Warning:

Copying is strongly forbiddened. The codes in this repo should not be directly copied to finish the lab. If you have any difficulties in this lab, please refer to the guide book or my blog https://www.cnblogs.com/zhangleo/p/15963442.html which gives a detailed description of each part in the lab. Have fun :)
